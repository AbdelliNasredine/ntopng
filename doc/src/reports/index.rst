ntopng is able to produce traffic reports based on historical data coming both from timeseries (RRD or Influxdb) and database (flow data).
A report template editor is also available in the web gui to build custom reports.

This section shows how to visualize reports, configure ntopng to automatically generate periodic reports, manage the retention, and build custom reports.
