Configuration Backup
====================

ntopng manages configuration backup/restore using the ntopng-utils-manage-config utility
which is installed by the ntopng package.

It is possible to run this utility manually to create a tarball containing the ntopng configuration with:

.. code:: bash

   ntopng-utils-manage-config -a backup -c archive.tar.gz -r

Note that -r is used to also include the runtime ntopng configuration stored on redis.

It is possible to run the same utility to manually restore the configuration starting from a targall
previously created using the same utility with:

.. code:: bash

   ntopng-utils-manage-config -a restore -c archive.tar.gz -r
